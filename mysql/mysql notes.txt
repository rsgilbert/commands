TEXT can hold upto 64kb of data

ALTER TABLE birds_copy ALTER conservation_status_id DROP DEFAULT;

auto_increment guarantees that the new 
record created will have a unique key greater than
all other keys in the field. 
Auto_increment does not guarantee id's will
increase by 1 all the time

An error during insert can increase auto_increment regardless

To find current auto_increment, use SHOW CREATE TABLE birds

InnoDB engine doesnot understand AlTER TABLE country_codes ORDER BY country_name;

how indexes work:
Basically, when a SELECT is run in which
the user wants to search the table based on the person’s last name, MySQL will use the
human_names index that we created, and not search the name_last column sequentially.
That’s what we want. That will make for a quicker search.

database development is generally always a work in progress

// ordering by default is whatever order the items were found in the table

LIMIT 3 is the same as LIMIT 0, 3; 0 is the starting  point ie how many to skip, 3 are how many to return

<> is the same as != and they are the opposite of =. They are the inequality signs

// notes on pattern matching
REGEXP and NOT REGEXP
Default matches words that start like the given pattern
On the column if collation is binary eg latin1_bin, matches are Case sensitive by default
but if the collation on the column is not binary eg utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci, matches are case insensitive by default

Use BINARY tag for case sensitive pattern matching on collumns whose collation is not binary

// character classes and name are put between two pairs of double brackets
// character class: given between a pair of colons eg. 
[[:alpha]] for alphabetic characters

// character name: given between a pair of dots eg. 
[[.hyphen.]] for a hyphen

// LIKE
% is the wildcard that matches any amount of characters
